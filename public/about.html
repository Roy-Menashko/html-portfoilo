<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Data Engineering student with a strong foundation in Python, Java, and SQL.
  In addition to my core studies, I am currently expanding my skill set by learning full-stack development.
  This includes gaining proficiency in front-end languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
  as well as back-end technologies such as Node.js and databases like MongoDB.
  My goal is to have a well-rounded understanding of both data engineering and full-stack development, enabling me to tackle complex projects that require both front-end and back-end expertise.
